# Recon8D: A metabolic regulome network from oct-omics and machine learning
Recon8D utilizes oct-omics (genomics, histone PTMs, DNA methylation, transcriptomics, RNA splicing, miRNA, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics) to predict metabolomic variation across cancer lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, thereby inferring a multiomic prediction network of the metabolome.
